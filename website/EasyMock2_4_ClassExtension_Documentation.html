<h2>EasyMock Class Extension 2.4 Readme</h2>

<p>Documentation for release 2.4 (August 30 2008)<br />
&copy; 2003-2008 <a href="http://www.offis.de">OFFIS</a>, Henri Tremblay.
</p>
<p>
The EasyMock Class Extension allows to generate
Mock Objects for classes.
</p>

<a id="Requirements"/><h2>Requirements</h2>

The EasyMock Class Extension requires 
<a href="http://java.sun.com">Java 5 or above</a>,
<a href="http://www.easymock.org">EasyMock 2.4</a>, 
<a href="http://cglib.sourceforge.net">cglib 2.1</a> 
(2.0.x also works but cannot mock a class without visible constructor),
<a href="http://forge.objectweb.org/projects/asm">asm</a> 
(use the version that matches your cglib version, you can also use cglib-nodep-2.1.jar which includes asm)
and <a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit 4</a> to run the tests.

<a id="Usage"/><h2>Usage</h2>

To generate Mock Objects for classes <b>and</b> interfaces, use
<pre>
import static org.easymock.classextension.EasyMock.*;
</pre>
instead of
<pre>
import static org.easymock.EasyMock.*;
</pre>
You will then create a mock just like with EasyMock by doing something like this:
<pre>
ToMock mock = createMock(ToMock.class);
</pre>
From now on, you will use your mock just like you use to do with
EasyMock. Note that <code>createNiceMock</code>, <code>createStrictMock</code>, 
<code>createStrictControl</code>, <code>createControl</code> and 
<code>createNiceControl</code> methods are also available. The <code>create...Control()</code> methods
return <code>org.easymock.classextension.IMocksControl</code>, an extension of EasyMock's <code>IMocksControl</code>.

<a id="Advanced"/><h2>Advanced</h2>
  
<a id="Partial_mocking"/><h3>Partial mocking</h3>  
<p>
Sometimes you may need to mock only some methods of a class and keep
the normal behavior of others. This usually happens when you want to
test a method that calls some others in the same class. So you want to
keep the normal behavior of the tested method and mock the others.
</p>
<p>
In this case, the first thing to do is to consider a refactoring since
most of the time this problem caused by a bad design. If it's not
the case or if you can't do otherwise because of some development constraints,
here's the solution.
</p>
<pre>
ToMock mock = createMock(ToMock.class, 
   ToMock.class.getMethod("mockedMethod", null));
</pre>
<p>In this case only the methods passed to <code>createMock</code> will be 
mocked (<code>mockedMethod()</code> in the example). The others will still 
behave as they used to. One exception: abstract methods are conveniently mocked by default.
</p>
<p>The class extension's <code>IMocksControl</code> also provides a <code>createMock()</code> method
to create partial mocks.
</p>
<p>
<b>Remark:</b> EasyMock provides a default behavior for Object's methods (<i>equals, hashCode, toString</i>).
However, for a partial mock, if these methods are not mocked explicitly, they will have their normal behavior
instead of EasyMock default's one.
</p>

<a id="Self_testing"/><h3>Self testing</h3>  
<p>
It is possible to create a mock by calling one of its constructor. This can be handy when a
class method needs to be tested but the class other methods, mocked. For that you call a 
<code>createMock()</code> method with a <code>ConstructorArgs</code>. See the
<code>ConstructorCalledMockTest</code> for an example.
</p>

<a id="Replace_default_instantiator"/><h3>Replace default instantiator</h3>
<p>
For some reason (usually an unsupported JVM), it is possible that EasyMock CE isn't able to create
a mock in your environment. Under the hood, class instantiation is implemented with a factory
pattern. In case of failure, you can replace the default instantiator with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The good old <code>DefaultClassInstantiator</code> which works well with Serializable classes
and otherwise tries to guess the best constructor and parameters to use.</li>
<li>You own instantiator which only needs to implement <code>IClassInstantiator</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
You set this new instantiator using <code>ClassInstantiatorFactory.setInstantiator()</code>.
You can set back the default one with <code>setDefaultInstantiator()</code>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Important:</b>
The instantiator is kept statically so it will stick between your unit tests. Make sure you
reset it if needed.
</p>

<a id="Limitations"/><h2>Limitations</h2>

<p> 
EasyMock Class Extension provides a built-in behavior for <code>equals()</code>, 
<code>toString()</code> and <code>hashCode()</code>. It means that you cannot
record your own behavior for these methods. It is coherent with 
<a href="EasyMock2_3_Documentation.html#Object_Methods">what
EasyMock do</a>. This limitation is considered to be a feature
that prevents you from having to care about these methods.
</p>
<p>
Final methods cannot be mocked. If called, their normal code will be executed.
</p>
<p>
Private methods cannot be mocked. If called, their normal code will be executed. 
Remember this can occur during partial mocking.
</p>
<p>
Class instantiation is performed using 
<a href="http://objenesis.googlecode.com/svn/docs/index.html">Objenesis</a>.
Supported JVMs are listed 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/objenesis/wiki/ListOfCurrentlySupportedVMs">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
In the <a href="#Advanced">Advanced section</a>, it was explained how to do
partial mocking. One important thing is that private methods are never mocked.
So if your method under test is calling some private methods, you will need to
test them as well since you cannot mock them.
